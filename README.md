Introduction 

• Image demosaicing is the process of reconstructing a full-color image from a single sensor that captures only a portion of the color information at each pixel location. The Bayer pattern is a common type of color filter array used in digital cameras and smartphones. It uses a pattern of red, green, and blue filters arranged in a checkerboard like pattern. In this homework, you are requested to design a circuit to transform an image in the Bayer pattern to a full-color image.
